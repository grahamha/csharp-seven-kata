     * Returning a Task object from async methods can introduce performance bottlenecks in certain paths. 
     * Task is a reference type, so using it means allocating an object. 
     * 
     * In cases where a method declared with the async modifier returns a cached result, or completes synchronously, the extra allocations can become a significant time cost in performance critical sections of code. 
     * It can become very costly if those allocations occur in tight loops.
     * 
     * The new language feature means that async methods may return other types in addition to Task, Task<T> and void. 
     * The returned type must still satisfy the async pattern, meaning a GetAwaiter method must be accessible. 
     * As one concrete example, the ValueTask type has been added to the .NET framework to make use of this new language feature.
