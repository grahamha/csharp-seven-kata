     * From: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/csharp-7#tuples
     C# provides a rich syntax for classes and structs that is used to explain your design intent. 
     But sometimes that rich syntax requires extra work with minimal benefit. 
     You may often write methods that need a simple structure containing more than one data element. 
     To support these scenarios tuples were added to C#. 
     Tuples are lightweight data structures that contain multiple fields to represent the data members. 
     The fields are not validated, and you cannot define your own methods

    Differences between ValueTuple and TupleThe primary reason for introduction of ValueTuple is performance.
